> Our website has an image of a table displaying copay information for various medical appointments. We need a reliable way to validate certain configurations such as in-network hearing exams having a “$0 copay”.

#### Automation Requirement(s)
- construct an extensible solution for validating the contents of any cell in the table
- expliticly test validate the contents of the _In-Network Hearing Exam_ cell

#### Notes
- The necessary screenshot is already part of the suite. It can be found within the `Resources` folder.

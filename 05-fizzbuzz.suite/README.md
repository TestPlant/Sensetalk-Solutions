> To most developers, **FizzBuzz** is nothing more than a trivial formality often utilized within interviews to quickly identify those that have basic programming knowledge from those that do not.

#### Automation Requirement(s)
- write a command that does the following:
  - print each number starting from `1` through to `100` on a new line
  - if the number is a multiple of `3`, print the string `Fizz` instead of the number
  - if the number is a multiple of `5`, print the string `Buzz` instead of the number
  - if the number is a multiple of **both** `3` _and_ `5`, print the string `FizzBuzz` instead of the number

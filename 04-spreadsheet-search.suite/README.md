> A couple of guys from work--Ryan and Dwayne (I think)--recently asked me for their manager's password. I told them no, but I don't like anyone here and I couldn't care less. So I figured I could give them a script that searches the database for a matching username and returns the account's password.

#### Automation Requirement(s)
- create a handler that does the following:
    - consumes a username
    - searches the enclosed spreadsheet
    - logs the matching password to the console
- if no match is found, it should log an appropriate error message
- specifically test against Jim Halpert's account
- don't tell Jim

#### Notes
- The necessary spreadsheet containing all users is already part of the suite. It can be found within the `Resources` folder.
